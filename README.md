## Some things I missed in prototype:

- Import img src instead of hard code inline style.
- Function setUserInput should derived from the previous state instead of the snap shot!
- Learn how to use the formatter.
- You can make some caculation in map's callback function.
- Add the fool-proof mechanism for result-table.
- Reminder:e.target.value in input is 'string', even though the type of input is 'number'.
- Skill: You can use the "+newValue" instead of "parseInt(newValue)".
